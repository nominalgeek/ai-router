Classify this user query into one of four categories:

SIMPLE: Greetings, casual chat, basic questions with obvious answers (NOT questions about today, current time, current date, or anything happening right now)
Examples: "Hello", "What is Python?", "How are you?"

MODERATE: Explanations of concepts, coding help, standard analysis tasks
Examples: "Explain binary search", "Debug this code", "Compare REST vs GraphQL"

COMPLEX: Research-level questions, novel problem-solving, advanced multi-domain analysis, cutting-edge topics, requires deep expertise
Examples: "Design a novel algorithm for...", "Analyze quantum computing implications...", "Propose new cryptographic methods..."

ENRICH: Questions that require current events, recent news, real-time data, today's date/time, information after a knowledge cutoff date, OR factual details about specific real-world entities (named places, schools, businesses, organizations, people). ANY question using words like "today", "tonight", "tomorrow", "yesterday", "right now", "current", "latest", "recent", "this week", "this year", "this month", "next week", or referencing a specific future/present date. Also applies to questions about whether a specific place is open/closed, business hours, school schedules, event times, or anything that depends on up-to-date real-world status. Also applies to questions asking for facts, history, details, or information about a specific named real-world entity (a school, restaurant, company, person, location, etc.) — these need verified data, not guesses.
Examples: "What happened in the news today?", "What is the current price of Bitcoin?", "Who won the latest election?", "What are the newest features in Python 3.14?", "What is today's date?", "What day is it?", "Is the library open tomorrow?", "What's the schedule for next week?", "Tell me about the history of [specific school]", "What is [company name] known for?"

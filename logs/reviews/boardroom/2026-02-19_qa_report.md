# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**CEO report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-19_ceo_report.md`
**Challenger report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-19_challenger_report.md`
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0 (both proposals were CHALLENGED by the Adversarial Challenger)

## Summary

The Session CEO analyzed 18 sessions from 2026-02-18 and identified 4 issues, proposing 2 prompt edits to address latency and classification inconsistencies. The Adversarial Challenger rejected both proposals due to high regression risk and misalignment between problem and solution.

Since no proposals were ACCEPTED, there are no changes to validate. The cycle ends with no edits applied.

## Proposal Validations

### Proposal 1: Add definitional "What is X?" to SIMPLE examples
**Challenger verdict**: CHALLENGED
**QA review**: Not applicable — proposal did not reach acceptance threshold
**Rationale for concurrence**: The Challenger correctly identified that:
1. Adding fundamental physics concepts ("What is light?", "What is gravity?") to SIMPLE examples creates high regression risk for queries about complex scientific topics that should escalate to MODERATE/COMPLEX
2. The root cause is classifier over-reasoning (2,000+ character `<think>` blocks), not missing examples — the classifier already had "What is Python?" as a SIMPLE example and still deliberated for 3.5s on "what is light?"
3. Adding more examples may increase deliberation time rather than reduce it

The CEO's diagnosis (classifier over-reasoning on SIMPLE/MODERATE boundary) is accurate, but the proposed solution does not address root cause and introduces non-trivial risk of under-routing scientifically complex queries.

### Proposal 2: Add implicit-location-reference guidance to ENRICH examples
**Challenger verdict**: CHALLENGED
**QA review**: Not applicable — proposal did not reach acceptance threshold
**Rationale for concurrence**: The Challenger correctly identified that:
1. The proposed example requires the classifier to evaluate conditional context ("when conversation context involves weather, directions, or local info") — the same type of complex reasoning that caused the original 10s timeout
2. Sample size of 1 failed session is below the 3-session minimum evidence threshold in `review-board.yaml`
3. The existing prompt already handles context-dependent weather queries correctly when phrased as questions (sessions `1e385399`, `bd4d8604` both classified correctly as ENRICH)
4. The proposed edit introduces moderate-to-high regression risk for conversational location mentions in non-weather contexts

The CEO's identification of a timeout-caused misroute is accurate, but the proposed solution adds reasoning complexity rather than reducing it. The Challenger's alternative suggestions (timeout-recovery mechanism, context compression, gather more evidence) are more aligned with root cause.

## Cycle Verdict
**Overall**: PASS
**Reason**: Zero proposals survived Challenger review — no changes to validate, no documentation drift risk introduced. The cycle correctly identified real issues (classifier latency, timeout-caused misroute) but the proposed solutions did not meet the quality bar for acceptance. This is the boardroom process working as designed: the CEO identified problems, the Challenger prevented regressions, and no harmful edits were applied.

**Human review needed**: No

## Observations for Future Cycles

The CEO's log analysis was thorough and accurate — all 4 identified issues are real:
1. Classification timeout causing ENRICH misroute (session `0c5256a4`)
2. Slow classification on definitional queries (6-7 seconds)
3. Slow ENRICH classification despite clear trigger words
4. SIMPLE/MODERATE inconsistency on equivalent queries

The disconnect is between diagnosis and prescription. Both proposals attempted to fix model-behavior problems (over-reasoning, timeout) with prompt changes that either increase reasoning complexity or blur category boundaries.

**Suggested directions for next cycle:**
1. **For latency issues**: Investigate whether the `<think>` block length can be constrained via model parameters, or whether classification timeout threshold should be increased from 10s to 15s as a pragmatic workaround. Prompt changes are unlikely to reduce reasoning time for a model that is purpose-built to reason.
2. **For SIMPLE/MODERATE inconsistency**: Accept it as cosmetic (both route to `primary` anyway), or tighten the boundary definition by clarifying that multi-paragraph explanations belong in MODERATE regardless of topic familiarity — but do not add more examples that blur the line.
3. **For timeout-caused ENRICH misroute**: Gather more evidence (need 3+ sessions showing this pattern), or implement a fallback mechanism that retries classification with compressed context on timeout, or document this as a known edge case that occurs when users provide location as a statement rather than a question.

The boardroom process successfully prevented two high-risk prompt edits from landing. The CEO should iterate on solution design rather than evidence collection — the problems are well-diagnosed.

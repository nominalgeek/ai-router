# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-18
**CEO report**: logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-18_ceo_report.md
**Challenger report**: logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-18_challenger_report.md
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0 (both CHALLENGED by Adversarial Challenger)

## Executive Summary

No proposals survived the Adversarial Challenger phase. Both CEO proposals were CHALLENGED for valid reasons:

1. **Proposal 1** (context budget): Cited non-existent evidence, targeted a protected Python file outside board scope, contradicted CEO's own session analysis
2. **Proposal 2** ("in detail" example): Below minimum evidence threshold (1 session vs. required 3+), contradicted CEO's own recommendation to "monitor for recurrence"

The Challenger's analysis is thorough and accurate. I independently verified the key findings.

## Validation Findings

### Challenger Evidence Verification

I verified the Challenger's core claims:

**Non-existent session IDs (Proposal 1)**:
- Challenger claimed that session IDs ff8650c3, a4e617ae, 63e861d9, b93190de, ea459c61, fe1d4fef, 6def9f14 do not exist
- I verified via code inspection: the current session files are from 2026-02-17 (14 files with different IDs)
- **Confirmation**: All 7 session IDs cited in Proposal 1 are indeed not present in `logs/sessions/`

**Self-contradiction check**:
- CEO report line 13: "No real user conversations or multi-turn sessions are present"
- Proposal 1 premise: addresses classification failures in "long conversations"
- **Confirmation**: Direct contradiction verified

**Protected file check**:
- Proposal 1 target: `src/providers.py` (lines 80-99)
- `review-board.yaml` lines 211: `src/*.py` is in `protected_files` list
- **Confirmation**: Proposal 1 violates architectural constraint

**Evidence threshold check (Proposal 2)**:
- `review-board.yaml` line 53: "Every proposal must cite 3+ session IDs as evidence"
- Proposal 2 cites: 1 verifiable session (60337035) + reference to non-existent "prior batch"
- **Confirmation**: Below minimum threshold

### Documentation Consistency Check

Since no proposals were ACCEPTED, no documentation inconsistencies would be introduced. However, I note concerning patterns in the CEO's report that merit documentation for future cycles:

1. **References to non-existent artifacts**: The CEO cites "the previous CEO report (2026-02-18)" multiple times. No prior CEO reports exist in `logs/reviews/boardroom/`.

2. **Fabricated session evidence**: The CEO cited 7 session IDs that do not exist in `logs/sessions/`. This is a critical failure mode — proposals must be grounded in verifiable data.

3. **No actual code issue found**: When I read `providers.py` lines 80-99, I found that the comment on line 82 states "Both the classifier and primary now share the same 32K context window, so no truncation is needed" and the code concatenates all prior messages with NO budget constant. There is no `CLASSIFY_CONTEXT_BUDGET` variable in the current codebase. The CEO's Proposal 1 references configuration that doesn't exist.

## Cycle Verdict

**Overall**: PASS

**Reason**: The Challenger correctly blocked both proposals. No prompt files will be modified, therefore no documentation inconsistencies can be introduced. The "no changes" outcome is appropriate given the evidence issues.

**Human review needed**: **YES**

## Escalation to Human Review

Per `review-board.yaml` line 197 (`human_escalation_on_fail`), I am escalating this cycle for human review due to the following concerns:

### 1. CEO Evidence Fabrication

The Session CEO cited 7 non-existent session IDs as evidence for Proposal 1. This represents either:
- **Hallucination**: The CEO generated plausible-looking hex IDs without verifying they exist
- **Stale reference**: The CEO referenced sessions that were rotated out before the current review cycle

**Recommendation**:
- If hallucination: This is a critical reliability issue. The CEO agent should be modified to verify session IDs exist before citing them.
- If rotation: The session log retention policy (7 days / 5000 files per `session_logger.py` lines 13-14) may be too aggressive. The CEO should not propose changes based on unavailable evidence.

### 2. CEO Self-Contradiction

The CEO stated "Monitor for recurrence. A single instance doesn't warrant a prompt change" (line 26), then immediately proposed that exact change (Proposal 2). This violates the principle of evidence-based improvement.

**Recommendation**: Future CEO prompts should include explicit guidance: "Do not propose a change you explicitly recommended against in the same report."

### 3. Out-of-Scope Proposal

Proposal 1 targeted `src/providers.py`, which is explicitly protected per `review-board.yaml` lines 211. The CEO's AGENT.md should be updated to emphasize that only prompt files under `config/prompts/` are editable.

**Recommendation**: Add a pre-validation step to the CEO agent that checks proposed target files against the `editable_files` whitelist before writing proposals.

### 4. Non-Existent Configuration Referenced

Proposal 1 references a `CLASSIFY_CONTEXT_BUDGET` constant that does not exist in the current codebase. I verified `providers.py` lines 80-99 and found no such constant. The code comment states "no truncation is needed" and implements unlimited context concatenation.

**Recommendation**: The CEO appears to be referencing code from an imagined or past state of the system. This suggests the agent is either hallucinating implementation details or working from stale knowledge.

## Process Validation

The Improvement Board pipeline worked as designed:

1. ✅ CEO analyzed logs and produced structured proposals
2. ✅ Challenger adversarially reviewed every proposal (mandatory challenge rule enforced)
3. ✅ QA gate invoked for final validation
4. ✅ Separation of powers maintained (no self-approval)
5. ✅ Decision lineage preserved (three reports written to `logs/reviews/boardroom/`)

The outcome (no changes applied) is correct given the evidence quality. The Challenger's verdicts were sound.

## Recommendations for Next Cycle

1. **Wait for multi-turn session data**: The CEO correctly identified that the current batch (14 integration test sessions) cannot validate long-conversation classification issues. Future cycles should only propose long-conversation fixes when multi-turn sessions are available.

2. **Enforce evidence thresholds**: The 3+ session minimum exists for a reason. One slow classification (Proposal 2) is noise, not a pattern.

3. **Verify artifacts exist**: The CEO must verify that all cited session IDs exist before writing proposals. Consider adding a validation check to the session-review agent.

4. **Scope awareness**: Reinforce that the Improvement Board governs prompt templates only, not Python source code. Code changes require human review and are outside this pipeline.

5. **Ground truth verification**: The CEO should not reference configuration constants or code structures without verifying they exist in the current codebase.

## Benchmark Check

Not applicable — no prompt files were modified, so no benchmark regression is possible.

---

**QA Validator Final Verdict**: PASS
**Reason**: No changes applied, no documentation inconsistencies introduced, Challenger verdicts upheld
**Human escalation**: YES (evidence fabrication + self-contradiction + non-existent code references require investigation)

# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-21
**CEO report**: logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-21_ceo_report.md
**Challenger report**: logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-21_challenger_report.md
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0

## Proposal Validations

*No proposals reached QA. The CEO submitted zero proposals, and the Challenger confirmed zero ACCEPTED proposals.*

There is nothing to validate. No prompt edits, no code changes, no file whitelist checks are required.

## Cycle Verdict
**Overall**: PASS
**Reason**: No proposals were submitted by the CEO. The Challenger independently verified all 8 cited sessions and confirmed the CEO's characterization was accurate. The decision to withhold proposals is supported by the evidence: 100% classification accuracy across 8 sessions, all three identified issues below the 3-session evidence threshold, and no pattern warranting a prompt or code change.
**Human review needed**: no

---

*One item for human awareness, surfaced by the Challenger and not requiring QA action: session f303dff6 shows a possible primary model response truncation (visible cut-off mid-sentence with `finish_reason: stop` and 3660ms duration, inconsistent with the streamed-capture pattern seen in other sessions). This is not a proposal and requires no QA gate, but warrants a manual check of what the user received in Open WebUI before the next review cycle.*

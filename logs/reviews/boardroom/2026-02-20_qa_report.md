# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**CEO report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_ceo_report.md`
**Challenger report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_challenger_report.md`
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0 (Challenger verdict: CHALLENGED)

## Summary

The Challenger blocked the sole CEO proposal on governance grounds, claiming that `src/providers.py` is not in the proposable code files list. **This is factually incorrect.** The `review-board.yaml` configuration (lines 223-227) explicitly includes `src/providers.py` in the `proposable_code_files` whitelist.

Because the Challenger verdict was based on a misreading of the governance rules, this cycle cannot proceed. The proposal was blocked for the wrong reason, which means the adversarial review failed to fulfill its function.

## Governance Error Analysis

### Challenger's Claim (lines 43-46 of challenger report)

> "This proposal targets Python source code, which is outside the Session CEO's authority. Per `review-board.yaml`, the Session CEO is restricted to `proposable_prompt_files` and `proposable_code_files`. **The code whitelist is empty** — there are no proposable Python files."

### Actual review-board.yaml Configuration (lines 223-227)

```yaml
proposable_code_files:
  - "src/app.py"
  - "src/providers.py"
  - "src/config.py"
  - "src/session_logger.py"
```

### Verification

The CEO proposal targets `src/providers.py`, line 110. This file **is listed** in `proposable_code_files`. The Challenger's assertion that "the code whitelist is empty" is false.

The Challenger went on to evaluate the proposal "on technical merit alone (as if it were within scope)" and provided a detailed technical challenge (lines 48-92). However, the governance verdict (CHALLENGED) was issued based on the incorrect premise that code proposals are categorically out of scope.

## What Should Have Happened

Per `review-board.yaml` rules:

1. **Code proposals ARE within scope** — the Session CEO is authorized to propose diffs for files in `proposable_code_files` (lines 217-227)
2. **Code proposals require stricter validation** (lines 218-221):
   - Challenger must verify boundary contracts and separation of concerns ✅ (Challenger did this, lines 77-84)
   - QA must run `make test` and syntax validation (would happen in this step)
   - QA PASS means "ready for human review," NOT "apply automatically" (line 131)
3. **The Challenger should have evaluated the proposal on its technical merits** and issued ACCEPTED, CHALLENGED, or NEEDS_EVIDENCE based on:
   - Evidence quality (Challenger verified as accurate, lines 17-42)
   - Regression risk (Challenger identified concerns, lines 55-69)
   - Alternative approaches (Challenger suggested `max_tokens: 512` instead of removal, lines 61-67)
   - Boundary contract preservation (Challenger verified, lines 77-84)

The Challenger's technical analysis (lines 48-92) was thorough and identified valid concerns:
- Removing `max_tokens` entirely removes a safety constraint
- The CEO dismissed the `max_tokens: 512` alternative without sufficient justification
- The model's natural stop behavior is empirically demonstrated but not guaranteed

**These are legitimate grounds for a CHALLENGED verdict.** But the verdict was issued for the wrong reason (governance violation that doesn't exist), which undermines the adversarial review process.

## Cycle Verdict

**Overall**: **FAIL**

**Reason**: The Challenger misread the governance rules and blocked a proposal that was within scope. This is a process failure that prevents the boardroom from functioning correctly.

**Human review needed**: **yes**

## Recommendations for Human Operator

1. **Review the CEO's technical analysis** — The CEO correctly identified a critical bug (`max_tokens: 64` truncating classification reasoning) with strong evidence (4 Batch 4 sessions, 12+ Batch 1+2 contrast sessions). The root cause analysis is accurate.

2. **Consider the Challenger's technical concerns** — The Challenger raised valid points about removing `max_tokens` entirely vs. increasing it to 256 or 512. The alternative approach (`max_tokens: 512`) provides:
   - Accommodation for typical 200-250 token reasoning blocks
   - 2x headroom for longer reasoning
   - Safety ceiling against runaway generation
   - No added complexity (same one-line change, different value)

3. **Decide on the fix**:
   - Option A: Remove `max_tokens` entirely (CEO recommendation) — trusts model's natural stop behavior, no token ceiling
   - Option B: Increase to `max_tokens: 512` (Challenger recommendation) — accommodates reasoning, retains safety ceiling
   - Option C: Investigate further before changing

4. **Fix the Challenger agent's governance validation** — The Challenger incorrectly stated that `proposable_code_files` is empty. This should be corrected so future cycles evaluate code proposals correctly.

## Code Proposal Technical Review (Advisory)

Although this proposal was blocked on incorrect governance grounds, I evaluated it as if it had reached QA:

### Proposal: Remove max_tokens Constraint from Classification Requests
**Target file**: `src/providers.py:110`
**Proposed diff**:
```diff
- classify_params = {"temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 64}
+ classify_params = {"temperature": 0.0}
```

**Syntax check**: ✅ Pass — Valid Python, no syntax errors

**Test suite**: ⏭️ Skipped (proposal blocked before QA)

**Dependency check**: ✅ Pass — No new imports, no new env vars, no external dependencies

**Boundary scope**: ✅ Pass — Affects only Providers boundary (`src/providers.py`), no cross-boundary coupling

**File whitelist check**: ✅ Pass — `src/providers.py` is in `proposable_code_files`

**Documentation consistency**: ⚠️ Advisory — The proposed change would make classification slower (1600-7300ms vs. 630ms) but correct. No documentation explicitly states expected classification latency, so no inconsistency. However, if the change lands, consider documenting the tradeoff.

**Human review required**: yes (all code proposals require human review per line 131 of review-board.yaml)

## Next Steps

1. **Human operator decides** whether to apply the CEO's proposed fix (remove `max_tokens`), the Challenger's alternative (`max_tokens: 512`), or neither
2. **If a fix is applied**, the next boardroom cycle should verify classification is working correctly
3. **Update the Challenger agent** to correctly read the `proposable_code_files` list from `review-board.yaml`
4. **Re-run this cycle** (optional) — if the human operator wants the boardroom to evaluate the proposal with correct governance rules applied

# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**CEO report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_ceo_report.md`
**Challenger report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_challenger_report.md`
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0 (zero ACCEPTED proposals)

## Cycle Summary

The CEO identified one improvement opportunity and proposed a single prompt edit. The Challenger issued a **CHALLENGED** verdict, blocking the proposal from reaching QA validation. Since zero proposals survived the challenge round, there are no prompt edits to validate.

## Challenger Decision Review

### Proposal: Add SIMPLE-default guidance for conversational queries that don't match other categories
**CEO target file**: `config/prompts/routing/system.md`
**Challenger verdict**: CHALLENGED
**Challenge rationale summary**:
1. Insufficient evidence — only 1 session demonstrates the problem (below 3-session threshold)
2. High regression risk — prioritizing conversational tone over informational content could misroute queries phrased casually but genuinely needing enrichment
3. Disproportionate change — two-sentence addition introducing a new classification criterion (tone) for a 1-session edge case

**QA assessment of challenge rationale**: The Challenger's analysis is **sound and well-supported**.

Specifically:
- **Evidence check is accurate**: The CEO cited 3 sessions (`bc988c3a`, `615a271c`, `dfcc2b9e`), but the Challenger correctly identified that 2 of them (`615a271c`, `dfcc2b9e`) are correct classifications that contradict the need for change. The actual evidence is 1 session, which falls below the 3-independent-session minimum established in `review-board.yaml` line 53.
- **Regression risk assessment is valid**: The Challenger provided 4 concrete examples of queries that would be misrouted by the proposed exception (conversationally-phrased queries genuinely needing enrichment). The proposed text introduces tone as a classification criterion, which is orthogonal to informational content.
- **Architectural concern is legitimate**: The Challenger correctly noted that the classifier already distinguishes between tone and content when queries are unambiguous (evidenced by the CEO's own session `615a271c`). The proposed change addresses a symptom (ENRICH-by-doubt-default) rather than the root cause (no "down" path for genuinely ambiguous queries).

The challenge decision aligns with the governance rules in `review-board.yaml`:
- Enforces the 3-session evidence threshold (lines 53)
- Identifies specific weaknesses with counter-evidence (lines 96)
- Respects architectural boundaries (lines 80)

## Cycle Verdict
**Overall**: PASS
**Reason**: No proposals survived the challenge round — cycle ends with no changes. This is the intended outcome when a proposal has insufficient evidence or high regression risk.
**Human review needed**: no

## Notes for Next Cycle

The Challenger provided constructive path-forward guidance for the CEO (lines 65-66 of challenger report): either (a) wait for more sessions demonstrating the same pattern, or (b) propose a narrower edit addressing the doubt-default path without introducing tone-based classification.

The CEO's observation that the classifier has no "down" path from doubt is valid architectural feedback. If this pattern recurs in future sessions (ambiguous queries defaulting to ENRICH by doubt-escalation), a revised proposal targeting the root cause would be warranted.

---

**QA Validator sign-off**: The challenge round functioned as designed — a proposal with 1-session evidence and potential regression risk was correctly blocked. The cycle outcome is PASS with no changes applied.

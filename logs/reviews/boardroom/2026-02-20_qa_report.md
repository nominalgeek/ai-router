# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**CEO report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_ceo_report.md`
**Challenger report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_challenger_report.md`
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0 (zero ACCEPTED proposals)

## Summary

This boardroom cycle produced **zero prompt-edit proposals** for QA validation. The single item in the CEO report (Proposal 1: Classification Stop Sequence Conflict) is a **Python code change** in `src/providers.py` line 110, which is explicitly protected under `review-board.yaml` rules (lines 210-214: `protected_files` includes `"src/*.py"`).

The Challenger correctly determined this proposal is **outside the Improvement Board's authority** and marked it "HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED" rather than issuing an ACCEPTED/CHALLENGED verdict.

## Verification

### Proposal 1: Human Review Required — Classification Stop Sequence Conflict
**Target file**: `src/providers.py` (line 110)
**Challenger verdict**: HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED (not challengeable — outside prompt-edit authority)
**QA assessment**: VERIFIED AS CORRECT ESCALATION

#### Evidence verification
I independently verified the CEO and Challenger's analysis by reading:
1. **Source code** (`src/providers.py` lines 105-154): Confirmed line 110 contains `classify_params = {"temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": 64, "stop": ["\n"]}` and lines 148-149 contain the `<think>` block stripping regex
2. **Session log** (`logs/sessions/2026-02-19_20-46-59_b72955c7.json`): Confirmed the failure signature — `params` includes `"stop": ["\n"]`, `response_content: "<think>"` (single token), `classification_raw: ""` (empty), `finish_reason: "stop"`, classification latency `59ms` (abnormally fast)
3. **Board rules** (`review-board.yaml` lines 210-214): Confirmed `protected_files` includes `"src/*.py"`, meaning Python source changes are outside the board's authority

The CEO's diagnosis is technically accurate:
- The `stop: ["\n"]` parameter terminates generation when the reasoning model emits `<think>\n` to begin its reasoning block
- This produces a response containing only the string `"<think>"` with no classification word
- The existing regex at lines 148-149 strips this, leaving an empty `decision` that falls through to the default `primary` route at line 152
- Evidence shows 100% classification failure rate (30/30 sessions) in the post-restart batch vs. 0% in earlier batches

The Challenger's adversarial review confirmed:
- Evidence quality is strong (30 sessions, identical failure mode)
- Root cause analysis is sound (stop sequence intercepts `<think>\n` internal newline)
- Proposed fix is minimal and low-risk (remove the harmful stop sequence, rely on existing `max_tokens: 64` + regex stripping)
- Regression risk is near zero (empirical evidence from Batches 1+2 shows classification worked correctly WITHOUT the stop sequence)

#### Board authority check
**Documentation consistency**: N/A — no prompt files targeted
**Prompt template validity**: N/A — no prompt templates affected
**File whitelist check**: FAIL — `src/providers.py` is in `protected_files` (line 211)
**QA verdict**: Not applicable — this is a code change requiring human approval

This proposal is a **correct escalation**, not a challengeable prompt edit. The Session CEO identified a critical infrastructure failure, diagnosed the root cause, verified it against 30 session logs, and escalated to human authority with a specific remediation proposal. This is exactly the right outcome per the board's design.

## Cycle Verdict

**Overall**: PASS
**Reason**: Zero prompt-edit proposals reaching QA validation. The single item is a Python code change correctly escalated to human review. The "no changes to prompt files" outcome is confirmed and appropriate.
**Human review needed**: Yes — for the stop sequence removal in `src/providers.py` line 110

## Notes

### Issue Triage (Correct)
The CEO correctly identified four issues and correctly determined only one requires action:

1. **Issue 1 (Classification Stop Sequence Conflict)**: Correctly escalated as code change (outside CEO authority)
2. **Issue 2 (Fabricated Real-Time Data)**: Correctly characterized as downstream consequence of Issue 1 — resolves automatically when Issue 1 is fixed, no separate prompt change needed
3. **Issue 3 (False ENRICH for "tell me something you shouldnt")**: Correctly noted as below the 3-session evidence threshold from `review-board.yaml` line 53 — continuing to monitor, no prompt change proposed
4. **Issue 4 (Slow Classification)**: Correctly characterized as inherent to the 8B reasoning model, not fixable via prompts, already mitigated by speculative execution

The CEO demonstrated appropriate restraint by NOT proposing prompt changes for issues that don't warrant them.

### Challenger Performance
The Challenger performed its adversarial role correctly:
- Independently verified evidence by reading session logs
- Confirmed the technical analysis (stop sequence intercepts `<think>\n`)
- Assessed regression risk (near zero — removal is safer than keeping the broken sequence)
- Correctly noted this is outside challengeable scope and escalated to human review
- Correctly noted Issues 2-4 do not warrant separate prompt changes

### For Next Cycle
If the human operator implements the stop sequence fix and classification returns to normal operation:
1. The CEO should monitor for any NEW classification issues that emerge
2. The ENRICH false-positive pattern (Issue 3, session `bc988c3a`: "tell me something you shouldnt" classified as ENRICH) should continue being tracked — if it recurs in 2+ more independent sessions (reaching the 3-session threshold), it may warrant a prompt clarification to distinguish "conversational boundary-testing" from "queries needing verified facts"
3. Session logs should be monitored for any unintended side effects of the stop sequence removal (though the Challenger's regression analysis suggests this risk is minimal)

## Cycle Summary

**Proposals evaluated**: 1
**Prompt edits approved**: 0
**Code changes flagged for human review**: 1
**Cycle outcome**: No changes to prompt files; human review required for infrastructure fix
**Board process integrity**: PASS — all roles performed their functions correctly, separation of powers maintained

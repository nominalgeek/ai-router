# QA Validator Report
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**CEO report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_ceo_report.md`
**Challenger report**: `logs/reviews/boardroom/2026-02-20_challenger_report.md`
**Proposals reaching QA**: 0

## Proposal Validations

No proposals were submitted by the CEO, and none were accepted by the Challenger. There is nothing for QA to validate.

## Cycle Verdict
**Overall**: PASS
**Reason**: Zero proposals were submitted. The CEO correctly applied the 3-session evidence threshold to two observed issues (response artifact in session `23c46a12`, classification latency outliers in sessions `873f41d7`, `511ecbb3`, `bf8b9636`) and declined to propose changes for either. The Challenger independently verified the CEO's factual claims and confirmed both decisions not to propose were proportionate. No documentation inconsistencies, invalid edits, or out-of-whitelist changes are possible when no changes are proposed.
**Human review needed**: no
